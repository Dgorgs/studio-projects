According to a recently published study, the population of great white sharks off the U.S. Atlantic coast is growing. Maybe you've already heard about thisâ€”it's been in the news a lot this summer.
Today we have two NOAA biologists on the line, including the lead author of that study, to talk with us about what drove the precipitous decline in white sharks a few decades ago, and what exactly is behind their recovery.
The lead author of that study, Tobey Curtis, is a shark scientist with NOAA's Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office.
